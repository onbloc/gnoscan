# Gnoscan
Gnoscan is an opensource blockchain explorer for the Gnoland blockchain, aiming to make on-chain data readable and intuitive for everyone with a UI optimized for features unique to Gnoland such as Proof of Contributions (PoC), Realms (Smartcontract in Gno), GRC20s, and Boards.

## Project Overview
This repository hosts the codebase for the Gnoscan Interface. The interface is built using TypeScript and comes with rich features including a real-time dashboard for the Gnoland blockchain, recent blocks and transactions, details of realms, a full list of GRC20 tokens, and more.

## Development Setup
To set up the development environment, make sure you have Node.js version 18.14.2 installed. We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for managing Node.js versions. Follow these steps:

```bash
# Install Node.js version 18.14.2 (if not already installed)
$ nvm install 18.14.2

# Use Node.js version 18.14.2
$ nvm use 18.14.2
```

This project uses `yarn` as an alternative to `npm`. If you don't have yarn installed, run the following command:
```bash
$ npm i yarn -g
```

Next, install the prerequisite packages:
```bash
$ yarn install
```

To run the development environment, execute the following command:
```bash
$ yarn dev
# Access http://localhost:3000
```

To run the production environment, execute the following command:
```bash
$ yarn build && yarn start
# Access http://localhost:3000
```
