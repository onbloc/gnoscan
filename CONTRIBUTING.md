## Contributing
Thank you for considering contributing to GnoScan! We value and appreciate your input. Before submitting a pull request, please check the guidelines below.

### How to Contribute	

**Steps**
1. Check existing issues or pull requests before submitting a new one to avoid duplicate submissions.
2. Fork the GnoScan repository.
3. Create a new branch from the latest `develop` branch for your changes.
4. Make changes and commit them with a concise and descriptive message using the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format. Please check spelling, grammar, and remove any trailing whitespace.
5. Push your branch to your forked repository.
6. Submit a pull request with `develop` as the base branch.

**Branch Policy**
- Start contribution branches from `develop` and target `develop` when opening pull requests.
- The GitHub default branch (`main`) is not the contribution base. Do not target `main` unless a maintainer explicitly requests it.
- Before submitting, verify that the PR base is `develop` and the commit list and diff contain only the intended changes.

**Pull Request Language**
Write pull request titles and descriptions in English.

**Pull Request Title**
Your pull request title must follow the conventional commits format and start with one of the following types:
- **feat:** A new feature.
   - Use this type when you introduce a new feature to the codebase or enhance existing functionality.
   - Example: **feat: Add user authentication**
- **chore:** Routine tasks or maintenance.
   - Use this type when you perform tasks that don't directly change the codebase, such as updating dependencies, configuration changes, or setting up build processes.
   - Example: **chore: Update dependencies**
- **fix:** A bug fix.
   - Use this type when you fix a bug or an issue in the existing codebase.
   - Example: **fix: Resolve memory leak issue**
- **docs:** Documentation changes.
   - Use this type when you update documentation or contribution guidelines.
   - Example: **docs: Clarify the contribution base branch**
- **test:** Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.
   - Use this type when you add new tests to improve code coverage or fix existing tests that were incorrect or failing.
   - Example: **test: Add unit tests for user registration**
- **style:** Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code.
   - Use this type when you make changes that only affect the code's appearance, such as whitespace, indentation, or formatting adjustments.
   - Example: **style: Apply gofmt to the codebase**
- **refactor:** Refactoring code that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
   - Use this type when you restructure existing code to improve its readability, performance, or maintainability without changing its functionality.
   - Example: **refactor: Optimize database query logic**

This will help maintain a clean and consistent commit history and make it easier for other developers to understand the changes made in each commit.
